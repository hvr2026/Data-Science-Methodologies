SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess)
Phases:
Sample: Selecting a representative subset of data from the larger dataset for analysis. 
Explore: Examining the data visually and statistically to identify trends, patterns, and potential outliers. 
Modify: Transforming and cleaning the data by handling missing values, creating new variables, and preparing it for modeling. 
Model: Building a predictive model using the prepared data, such as a regression model or decision tree. 
Assess: Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to ensure its accuracy and reliability
